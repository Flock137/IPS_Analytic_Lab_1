## Introduction 
This lab is about how would you do some basic drone theoretical calculation (and simulation?) using a programming language (it's MATLAB in this case, but you may use other language, they should give out about the same results)

## Intruction
This repository is including: Assets (graphs), scripts, respective lab manual and report.

### Scripts
- [Part A](Analytic_Lab1_A.m) - Thrust and Torque model
- [Part B](Analytic_Lab1_B.m) - Hover Analysis 
- [Part C](Analytic_Lab1_C.m) - Yaw control
- [Part D](Analytic_Lab1_D.m) - Sensitivity 
- [Part E](Analytic_Lab1_E.m) - Uncertainty & Amendments

### Assets
- Graph of part [A](Assets/IPS_Lab1_A.png), [D](Assets/IPS_Lab1_D.png) and [E](Assets/IPS_Lab1_E.png). Note that it wasn't required for part E to have the graph, but I did it anyway.

### Lab manual and lab report 
- [Lab Manual](Lab_man-Report/Manual_Analytical-Lab1.docx) (prepared by Professor Nidal Kamel)
- [Lab report](Lab_man-Report/Report_Analytical_lab_1.pdf) - I can say that this is the documentation of this reporsitory
